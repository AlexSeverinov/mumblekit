=================================================

This is the source code of MumbleKit - a Mumble client framework
for iPhoneOS-based devices.

Mumble is gaming-focused social voice chat utility. The desktop
version runs of Windows, Mac OS X, Linux and various other Unix-like
systems. Visit its website at:

Building it
===========

To build this you need the iPhoneOS 3.0 SDK from Apple and an
Intel Mac running Mac OS X 10.5 or later.

Before starting your build, you will need to check out the re-
quired submodules.

 $ git submodule init
 $ git submodule update

This will fetch known "working" snapshot of CELT, Speex and
Protocol Buffers for Objective C.

Building it (Xcode.app)
=======================

To build using Xcode, simply open the MumbleKit Xcode project
(MumbleKit.xcodeproj in the root of the source tree) and press
Cmd-B to build.

Building it (command line)
=========================

To build from the command line, do something like this:

 $ xcodebuild -project MumbleKit.xcodeproj -sdk iphonesimulator3.1.3 -target MumbleKit -configuration Debug
